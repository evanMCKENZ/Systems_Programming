When testing the encoding written by myself, I compressed both the czy.c file and the czy file created by running the make czy command

The original file sizes of czy.c and czy are 4826 bytes and 17880 bytes respectively.

The encoded versions of these files very 4187 bytes and 11178 bytes.

Given these values, the compression ratios for these files would be given as (4187/4826) and (11178/17880).

The result of these ratios is 0.8675 and 0.625 respectively.

In comparison, when compressing these same files with gzip, we get sizes of 1820 and 4101 bytes.

Giving us a ratio of (1820/4826) and (4101/17880), or 0.229 and 0.377.

As we can see from these calculations, gzip is much more efficient at compressing our files than our encoder, but our encoder does shrinkl these files by a not insignificant margin.
